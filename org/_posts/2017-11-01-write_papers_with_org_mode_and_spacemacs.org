title: Write Paper With Spacemacs and Org Mode
excerpt: This tutorial talks about how to write paper with spacemacs and org mode
---
#+END_EXPORT

* Rationale
- Spacemacs makes Emacs set up easy.
- Latex becomes unreadable by humans quickly.
- Learning org-mode once, and you do not need to worry about Markdown, HTML,
  Latex set up in a lot of cases. You also get todo lists, calendars,
  coffee makers (maybe not), etc.

* Prerequisites
- Know and like [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. This is really not the place to learn Emacs from scratch.
- Basic understanding of Latex. If you are reading this post, you probably have
  already written tons of Latex.
- [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] installed properly.
- Latex compilers installed.

* Preparations
** Conventions
- I will use =C-x= for "Ctrl + x", =C-X= for "Ctrl + Shift + x", =M-x= for
  "Alt + x", etc.
- Notice in VIM mode, =SPC SPC= is equivalent to =M-x=. Both allow you to
  execute a Elisp command.
- I will use =SPC= for the space key.
** Install =latex= and =org= layers
If you already know spacemacs setup, you can skip this section. 

In Spacemacs, =SPC f e d= to open the =.spacemacs= file. This is the Spacemacs
configuration file, normally located at =~/.spacemacs=. Locate the variable
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=, ignoring the comments, it should look
somewhat like the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'()
#+END_SRC
Adding the required layers here. We need =latex=, =bibtex=, and =org=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'(
  latex
  bibtex
  org
  ;; other layers go here
  )
#+END_SRC
Now =SPC q r= to restart Spacemacs and install the layers.
** Create your paper
Find your favorite place in the file system and create a new folder. The files
we will be editing has a =.org= suffix. I will use =paper.org= in the rest of
this post.

* Hello Org-mode
